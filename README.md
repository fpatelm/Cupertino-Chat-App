Chat App Flutter project.

## Getting Started

The main branch is always up to date. If you want to see the code for a specific episode, clone the respective branch.

Before running the app, you need to make sure you have all the development tools on your mac os, windows or linux.

You need to have an account on firebase console and create your project in there, this project is private to you, reason why I dont shareb it.

After you have the project on firebase console, you can optioanlly setup firebase emulators omn your local computer to ease the development.

## Collaboration

If you want to work on an issue or minor features tickets, message me to add you as a collaborator to the repository.

Create a branch based on main with the name as the title of the ticker by replacinbg empty spaces with "\_".

Before pusghing your local branch to origin, rebase always with the newest changes on main.
